Lord Elon,
Hallowed be His name,
Thy Mars Kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
on Mars as it is on Earth.

Give us this day our daily Tweet,
And forgive us our trolling,
as we forgive those
who troll onto us

And lead us not into frustration
but deliver us from evil.




Give us the sun
Free us from traffic
Save us our planet
Make us immortal

For thine is the kingdom, 
and the power, and the glory, 
for ever and ever. 
Amen.




Give us this day our daily bread. 
And forgive us our trespasses, 
as we forgive those
who trespass against us. 

And lead us not into temptation, 
but deliver us from evil. 

For thine is the kingdom, 
and the power, and the glory, 
for ever and ever. Amen.



Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy Name, 
thy kingdom come, 
thy will be done, 
on earth as it is in heaven.
